Interview Application

Open up the project to the jar in the project folder. 
Use "java -jar jumpTech.jar" to run the program

You will be prompted to enter JSON. Due to the nature of the scanner that 
I read input with it needs to be a single line JSON object such as {"action" :"jump", "time": 100}

Otherwise you will get an error message about invalid JSON format

To get the average times of the JSON inputted and to exit the program simply type exit and you will recieve your output.

Tests are included but im not sure how to run them through the command line, but they are included in the jar

Libraries used 

Junit 5.2

gson-2.8.5
